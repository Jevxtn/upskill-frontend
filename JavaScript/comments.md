# Comments
JavaScript comments are used to add explanatory or descriptive notes to the code. The JavaScript interpreter ignores comments, so they do not affect how the program runs. You can use comments to clarify your code, add reminders, or temporarily disable specific code blocks. 

There are two types of comments in JavaScript:

## Single line comments
Single line comments start or end with double forward slashes (//). Typically, they serve as short notes or annotations.

Example:
```javascript
// This is an example of single line comment
let x = 4; // Assigning value 4 to variable x
```

## Multi-line comments
You can add both single-line and multi-line comments using this method. Multi-line comments are also referred to as blocks of comments.

Example:
```javascript
/* This is an example of single line comment */

/* This is an 
example of 
multi line comment */
```
